## Running the programs

To generate the executable codes (ilrp) of HGAMPP algorithm respectively for the CLRP, one can run 'make' command under code folder in linux system.

 ### The CLRP
_Usage:_ 

./code/ilrp instance depot_config outputFile bestValue isOptimal timeLimit numOfRuns randomSeed

- 'instance' is the input benchamrk instance
- 'depot_config' denotes the input depot configuration associated with the input instance, and this parameter can be removed
- 'outputFile' is the name of output file 
- 'bestValue' is the best result found from literature.
- 'isOptimal' is used to indicate whether the bestValue is the optimal result.
- 'timeLimit' is the time limit of each run
- 'numOfRuns' is the maximum runs of each run
- 'randomSeed' is the random seed 

_Note see script for details.

## Materials
This repository includes the following materials:

--Benchmark instances used in our paper (See the file named instances). One notices that the file also includes a set of depot configurations which are used for HGAMP. Of course, you can also adjust the code in commandline.h to overlook it. 
--Source codes of proposed HGAMP (See the source codes directory for the details.)   
--Detailed computational results and parameter analysis (See the detailed results directory for the details.)   
--Best solutions found in the experiments (See the certificate file for the details.)  
Note: The contents and formats of the files are demonstrated in the ReadMe file of corresponding subdirectory.
