# Authors

This file records the authorship, scientific supervision, funding context, and contributor policy of KAYROS. It is the authoritative statement of who wrote the software; machine-readable citation metadata lives in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff), and the license terms in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

## Author and maintainer

KAYROS is written and maintained by:

- **Florian Rascoussier** (Onyr), IMT Atlantique and INSA Lyon, France. [GitHub](https://github.com/0nyr) · [ORCID 0009-0005-3253-9814](https://orcid.org/0009-0005-3253-9814) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-rascoussier-onyr/) · <onyr.maintainer@gmail.com>

He is the sole author of the KAYROS codebase, with the exception of the vendored third-party component described below. Everything stays MIT-licensed.

## Vendored third-party code

The exact branch-price-and-cut component (`cpp/lera/`) is derived from the open-source solver of **Gonzalo Lera-Romero**, **Juan J. Miranda Bront** and **Francisco J. Soulignac**, published alongside *Linear edge costs and labeling algorithms: The case of the time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows*, Networks 76(1):24–53, 2020 ([doi:10.1002/net.21937](https://doi.org/10.1002/net.21937), [source repository](https://github.com/gleraromero/networks2020)). Provenance, the list of modifications, and the attribution history are documented in [`cpp/lera/NOTICE.md`](cpp/lera/NOTICE.md).

## AI-assisted development

KAYROS is developed with the assistance of AI coding tools (Claude, ChatGPT, and others) for code generation, documentation, and exploratory work. Claude Fable 5 in particular has been used extensively. The author remains solely responsible for all design decisions, all published claims, and all content of this repository.

## Scientific supervision

KAYROS is built as part of a [PhD in Informatics and Operations Research](https://theses.fr/s386454) at IMT Atlantique and INSA Lyon, supervised by:

- [**Romain Billot**](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/person/romain-billot), director of the PhD, IMT Atlantique, France
- [**Christine Solnon**](http://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/csolnon/), co-director of the PhD, INSA Lyon, France
- [**Lina Fahed**](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/person/lina-fahed), co-supervisor of the PhD, IMT Atlantique, France

## Funding and project context

This work is part of the ANR-MAMUT project, [ANR-22-CE22-0016](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-22-CE22-0016).

## Acknowledgements

The KAYROS solver is dedicated to the memory of my friend Thomas Garcia.

### The ANR-MAMUT project

KAYROS has benefited from the collaboration initiated around the [ANR-MAMUT project](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-22-CE22-0016) and its [MAMUT-routing benchmark catalog](https://github.com/ANR-MAMUT/MAMUT-routing), where KAYROS is the reference solver for the time-dependent problem families. The following people have contributed indirectly to the project and are acknowledged for their support (alphabetical order of last name):

- [Alexandru-Liviu Olteanu](http://www-labsticc.univ-ubs.fr/~olteanu/), Université Bretagne Sud, France
- [Adrien Pichon](https://orcid.org/0009-0005-8630-3962) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Anzury)), Université Bretagne Sud, France
- [Marc Sevaux](http://www-labsticc.univ-ubs.fr/~sevaux/), Université Bretagne Sud, France

### Individual acknowledgements

- A special mention to [**Christine Solnon**](http://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/csolnon/) for her guidance and for her decade-long involvement in time-dependent routing, going as far back as the [PhD of Pénélope Aguiar Melgarejo](https://hal.science/hal-01514369).
- [**Romain Fontaine**](https://github.com/romainfontaine), for his help with [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/), where every KAYROS validation and certification campaign runs. This PhD is a multi-vehicle follow-up to [his TDTSPTW thesis](https://hal.science/tel-04697323v1) and his dynamic-programming solver, [tdtsptw-ejor23](https://github.com/romainfontaine/tdtsptw-ejor23).
- [**Gonzalo Lera-Romero**](https://github.com/gleraromero), for his open-source contributions to the time-dependent routing literature: the branch-price-and-cut solver vendored and extended in KAYROS, and the [TDVRPTW benchmark best-known solutions](https://github.com/gleraromero/networks2020/blob/master/instances/dabia_et_al_2013/solutions.json) used as a reference in KAYROS and MAMUT-routing.
- [**Leon Lan**](https://github.com/leonlan), [**Niels Wouda**](https://github.com/N-Wouda), [**Wouter Kool**](https://github.com/wouterkool) and the other contributors to [PyVRP](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP), a major inspiration for the KAYROS anytime layer in three respects: the realization that a single-trajectory iterated local search is a strong, simple and scalable anytime metaheuristic for vehicle routing, the overall C++/Python architecture, and the competitive drive sparked by [this post by Niels](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP/issues/867#issuecomment-3045950768). At the time I had already been on this research stream for a year, and realizing I was not alone on the problem was very motivating.
- [**Thibaut Vidal**](https://github.com/vidalt), who initiated the movement of open-source vehicle routing solvers and whose [HGS-CVRP](https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP) is a reference anytime metaheuristic for the field. I have learned a lot from his work, and I am grateful for the open-source spirit he has fostered in the community.
- [**Geoffrey De Smet**](https://github.com/ge0ffrey), CTO of [Timefold](https://timefold.ai/), for his valuable feedback on the Timefold solver and his helpful private discussions.
