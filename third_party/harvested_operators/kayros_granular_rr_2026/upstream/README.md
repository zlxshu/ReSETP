# KAYROS

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kayros)](https://pypi.org/project/kayros/) [![SWH](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/badge/origin/https://github.com/0nyr/kayros/)](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/?origin_url=https://github.com/0nyr/kayros)

**KAYROS** is an exact & anytime solver for **duration-minimization time-dependent vehicle routing** problems, TDVRPTW (with time windows) and TDVRP, benchmarked on the canonical [MAMUT-routing](https://github.com/ANR-MAMUT/MAMUT-routing) TD instance families.

The name is a nod to [*Kairos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos), the ancient Greek notion of the *right, opportune moment*, fitting for a time-dependent solver where *when* each route departs is itself a decision. It is also a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym): **K**ayros **A**nytime-**Y**ielding **R**outing **O**ptimization **S**olver.

> Status: **beta**, developed as part of a PhD. Two solving modes on one exact time-dependent engine: an anytime time-dependent iterated local search that produced the large majority of the MAMUT store's best-known solutions (minimizing Duration or, since 1.2.0, FleetCostDuration — a fleet fixed cost plus duration, as priced by the Blauth2024 family; since 1.3.0 a fleet-descent route-elimination phase contests the fleet size itself, the mechanism behind the first best-known solutions beaten on that family; since 1.4.0 the first solution is published within a fraction of a second at every instance size, where it used to take minutes at n = 1000; since 1.5.0 the search starts from a deliberately over-provisioned fleet and shrinks it, which is worth double-digit percentages where waiting dominates; 1.6.0 adds an opt-in penalty-tolerant time-window squeeze and a K-capped confined search, the campaign tools behind the warm-started refresh that leaves all thirty Blauth2024 records kayros-held), and an audited exact branch-price-and-cut component (`kayros.lera`) whose multi-gate certification protocol stands behind the store's proven-optimal solutions (704 as of 2026-08-08: one certificate was retracted after a checker-valid counterexample and the pricing defect behind it repaired in 1.5.1, the 2026-08-06 re-certification re-derived 466 of 468 earlier stamps four-way bit-exactly on the repaired build with one withdrawn on a protocol disagreement, and the Poryos2026 families received their first 238 certificates). Every run ends with an honest verdict (optimum, time limit, or resource limit), never a silent kill.

## Install

```sh
pip install kayros    # or: uv add kayros / uv pip install kayros
```

This pulls everything, including the benchmark loaders and the reference checker ([`mamut-routing-lib`](https://pypi.org/project/mamut-routing-lib/)). For development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0nyr/kayros && cd kayros
pip install -e . --group dev    # pip >= 25.1 (or: uv pip install -e . --group dev)
```

Requirements: Python ≥ 3.11. Building from source (sdist or checkout) additionally needs a C++23 compiler, CMake ≥ 3.26 (fetched automatically by the build backend when missing) and Boost.Graph headers+library; the HiGHS LP solver is fetched and built statically by CMake when no install is found.

## Usage

Anytime heuristic solve: iterated local search over granular candidate lists, streaming every new incumbent:

```python
import kayros

# Any MAMUT-routing TD instance (.vrp.json with its .atf.json sidecar next to it)
instance_path = "benchmarks/TDVRPTW/Dabia2013/n=25/C101.vrp.json"
solution = kayros.solve(instance_path, time_limit=10.0, seed=42)
print(solution.duration, solution.num_routes, solution.status)

# Anytime: react to every new incumbent while the solve keeps running
def on_incumbent(incumbent, routes):
    print(f"[{incumbent.seconds:7.2f}s] {incumbent.value:.6f} ({incumbent.origin})")

solution = kayros.solve(instance_path, time_limit=60.0, on_incumbent=on_incumbent)
```

Instances are loaded without re-verifying their artifact digests, because materialization is deterministic and the check costs minutes and gigabytes of peak memory at n = 1000. Pass `verify=True` (to `kayros.solve` on a path, or to `kayros.io.load_instance`) on test runs and on the first run over data you have not used before: it re-derives the sidecar digests and the ATF digest and pins them against what the instance file declares, which is what catches a truncated download or a mismatched sidecar. Without it those failures are silent.

The default strategy is `"ils"` (single-trajectory iterated local search), picked over the alternatives in a 20,808-run head-to-head across five TD families at n=10..1000, with the margin growing with instance size. A MAX-MIN TD ant colony remains available as `Params(strategy="aco")`, and `Params(num_neighbours=0)` restores exhaustive (non-granular) local-search enumeration; both are alternatives for experimentation, not defaults.

Families that price vehicles (a normative `fleet_fixed_cost` field on the instance, e.g. [Blauth2024](https://github.com/ANR-MAMUT/MAMUT-routing)) can be solved under the **FleetCostDuration** objective: the same canonical duration fold plus `fleet_fixed_cost × num_routes`, priced bitwise by the reference checker. The fleet term is part of `solution.duration`; the local search then trades route dissolves against duration, helped by a route-dissolve perturbation kick.

```python
params = kayros.Params(objective="fleet_cost_duration")
solution = kayros.solve(instance_path, params, time_limit=10.0, seed=42)
print(solution.duration, solution.num_routes)  # cost includes the fleet term
```

Exact solve: branch-price-and-cut with checker-exact certificates, optionally warm-started from a known solution (the fast path when certifying near-optimal solutions, e.g. stored best-known ones):

```python
from mamut_routing_lib.td import load_td_instance
from kayros.lera import solve_duration

loaded = load_td_instance(instance_path)
result = solve_duration(loaded, time_limit_s=600.0,
                        initial_routes=[list(r) for r in solution.routes])
print(result["exact_log"]["status"], result["value"])
# status == "Optimum" with routes == [] means: the warm-start solution itself
# is proven optimal. On a time limit, result["exact_log"]["best_bound"] is a
# valid global lower bound when the root relaxation finished (absent otherwise).
```

`solution.duration` and `result["value"]` are always values computed by the reference checker (`mamut_routing_lib.td.check_td_solution`), never an internal approximation.

Resource limits are verdicts, not crashes: besides the hard time-limit deadline, the exact solve carries a **memory self-guard**: an RSS watermark polled at the same interruption points as the deadline. When pricing would outgrow the machine (full-horizon TDVRP labeling can exceed any node's RAM), the solve unwinds cleanly with `exact_log.status == "MemoryLimitReached"`, honest bounds, and no certificate. The default limit is resolved from the machine (own RSS + ~80% of available memory, capped by the cgroup limit); `solve_duration(memory_limit_mb=...)` overrides it, `0` disables.

## Design

KAYROS is two solving modes on one exact time-dependent engine:

- **The engine** (`cpp/pwlf`, `cpp/core`) represents arrival times as non-decreasing continuous piecewise-linear functions (NDCPWLF) and evaluates routes by exact function composition: a bit-identical C++ port of the reference checker's arithmetic (gated by an equivalence suite over the full benchmark set).
- **The anytime stack** (`kayros.solve`): greedy construction and a single-trajectory TD iterated local search (granular ruin-and-recreate kicks, late-acceptance hill climbing, restart-to-best), with a TD ant colony as an alternative strategy, over one time-dependent local-search layer using LCA-BST move evaluation (Blauth et al. 2024) with granular candidate lists: tree-ranked relocate/swap/2-opt\* where every *accepted* move is repriced by the checker-identical fold before it counts.
- **The exact component** (`kayros.lera`): the branch-price-and-cut solver of Lera-Romero, Miranda Bront & Soulignac (2020), vendored under `cpp/lera/` (see its `NOTICE.md`) on the open-source [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) LP backend, extended with deadline-compliant anytime behavior, warm starts through columns, TDVRP support, honest time-limit gap reporting, and the memory self-guard. Every column entering the master problem is repriced in the checker's arithmetic, so reported values (and optimality certificates) are checker-exact: *optimal under checker-exact route costs and standard LP/pricing tolerances, completeness modulo the search engine's epsilon dominance*. On stepwise (value-jump) travel-time functions the labeling switches automatically to an exact value-jump path: the steps' verticals travel through the piecewise-linear machinery as tagged first-class objects (jump vs departure-choice verticals, attained values preserved) instead of being smoothed into steep bridges, so pricing stays complete and stepwise certificates are single-run checker-exact certificates like any other. This path was promoted after a validation ladder ending in a 1444-run four-solve re-certification campaign that re-confirmed 93 stored certificates at their exact stored values with zero checker-infeasible priced columns (`cpp/lera/NOTICE.md` item 9 records the full history). Turning the LP dual bounds themselves into rigorous certificates (safe bounding) is future work.

## Core principles

- **The checker is the referee.** Every solution and every certificate is priced by the reference checker of `mamut-routing-lib`; the checker's value is the value.
- **Exact arithmetic.** Plain IEEE-754 doubles, no epsilon comparisons in the engine, no FMA contraction (`-ffp-contract=off`); results are bit-reproducible across machines.
- **Anytime first.** Time budgets are hard deadlines honored by every component (heuristics and exact search alike), and incumbents stream out as they are found; a solver that only answers at the end is not a solver you can interrupt.
- **Honest verdicts.** A run ends with an answer: optimum, time limit, or resource limit, with valid bounds where they exist. The solver is never OOM-killed mid-certificate, and it never claims more than its arithmetic supports.
- **One-command install, no proprietary dependency.** The default build, including the exact component, is pure open source; HiGHS is built statically into the wheels. The faster CPLEX backend for the BPC remains strictly a source-build opt-in (`-DLERA_LP_BACKEND=cplex`) and never ships in wheels.
- **One run is one thread.** No intra-run parallelism; parallelism belongs to the experiment layer above.
- **POD core.** The fresh C++ is plain structs, flat arrays and free functions: optimization-kernel style, no framework (the vendored BPC keeps its upstream style, contained under `cpp/lera/`).

## Archival and reproducibility

`kayros` is archived by [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/); the badge above tracks the archive status of the GitHub origin ([archived origin](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/?origin_url=https://github.com/0nyr/kayros), [archival visits](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/visits/?origin_url=https://github.com/0nyr/kayros)). For academic referencing, prefer Software Heritage identifiers (SWHIDs) of the exact archived revision or release tag over the moving repository origin; when reporting computational results, cite both the kayros release used and the MAMUT-routing benchmark artifacts it was run on.

## Branches

Development happens on `main`. One long-lived branch is deliberately **not** merged: `td-time-warp` prototypes penalised exploration of the time-infeasible region (time-warp moves in the local search). A controlled head-to-head found it a no-go for the default solver (parity at best, worse on several families at equal time budgets), so it is kept reachable behind `Params` for reproducibility rather than merged; the negative result is written up in full as a thesis appendix.

## Provenance

KAYROS is developed by [Florian Rascoussier (Onyr)](https://github.com/0nyr) as part of a [PhD in Informatics and Operations Research](https://theses.fr/s386454) (IMT Atlantique / INSA Lyon), under the supervision of Romain Billot, Christine Solnon and Lina Fahed. The NDCPWLF composition engine follows Visser & Spliet (2020)'s move-evaluation theorems; the local-search move evaluation follows Blauth et al. (2024); the exact component vendors the branch-price-and-cut solver of Lera-Romero, Miranda Bront & Soulignac (2020, MIT-licensed; provenance and local modifications documented in `cpp/lera/NOTICE.md`); the TD-ACO is a rewrite of the author's heuristic layer originally built on that same solver.
