// the feasible window minimizing the ejected clients' difficulty counters
// (p-counts, the NBRMH / BonnTour difficult-item idea; a client's count grows
// each time step 1 fails for it). All-or-nothing: any dead end, pop-budget or
// deadline hit restores the pre-attempt solution exactly (deterministic
// rebuild from a vertices snapshot, the perturb undo discipline). No step
// ever opens a route, so success means exactly one route fewer, all routes
// feasible, every client served.

// shared modulo helpers (ls/rng.h) and the caller only invokes this behind
// its fixed_route_cost > 0 gate, so Duration rng streams stay bitwise
// unchanged. The M7.0 staleness stamps are NOT maintained during the attempt;
// on success the caller must mark_all_touched(ss) before descending.
