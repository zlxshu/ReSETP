// TD time-warp primitives (Stream 8, P8.0 design memo).
//
// The exact core encodes a time window as a DOMAIN wall: make_theta caps the
// vertex function's domain at the deadline, and compose's img∩dom truncation
// erases late arrivals. The warp-augmented builders below replace that wall by
// a clamp-at-deadline plus a separate non-negative warp channel:
//
//   theta~_j(a) = max(e_j, min(a, l_j)) + s_j   (non-decreasing, then FLAT)
//   w_j(a)     = max(0, a - l_j)                (zero, then a +1 ramp)
//
// Everything stays inside the NDCPWLF algebra (no decreasing "back-in-time"
// functions). On arrivals a <= l_j the clamped builder executes the exact same
// arithmetic as make_theta, and compose processes its interior breakpoint at
// l_j with the same event/inversion arithmetic that today processes theta's
// domain end — this is what makes the augmented fold reduce BITWISE to the
// checker fold on the feasible region (gate G1/G2 in test_warp_equivalence).

// Warp-augmented vertex pair (theta~_j, w_j), both total on [0, t_end].
// Preconditions: earliest <= latest <= t_end.

// bitwise, a flat-run interior can never be a strict minimum of ys[k]-xs[k]
// (same y, smaller x than the kept run end), and zero-prefix detection keeps
// the run endpoints. This is what collapses the clamp-totality breakpoint
