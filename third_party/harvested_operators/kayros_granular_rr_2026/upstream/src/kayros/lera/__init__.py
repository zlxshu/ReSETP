"""Exact BPC component (Lera-Romero, Networks 2019), shipped in the default build.

The LP backend is HiGHS by default (no external dependency, built statically
into the wheels); CPLEX is a source-build opt-in via
``-DLERA_LP_BACKEND=cplex``. The bridge is in-memory: a loaded MAMUT TD
instance (+ ATF sidecars) is converted to the normalized payload the vendored
solver's preprocessing expects; no legacy instance files are involved.

Vertex conventions: MAMUT uses ``0..n`` with the depot at 0; Lera's BPC uses a
start depot ``o = 0``, customers ``1..n`` and a distinct end depot ``d = n+1``
(a copy of the depot). ``routes_to_mamut`` maps solver paths back.

Certificate arithmetic: all master objective coefficients are checker-exact
(every column repriced by the kayros port of the reference checker on the raw
MAMUT ATFs) and the reported ``value`` of a solution is bit-identical to
``compute_solution_cost`` on its routes. An optimality certificate therefore
reads as :data:`CERTIFICATE`: optimal under checker-exact route costs and
standard LP/pricing tolerances, with pricing completeness modulo Lera's
epsilon arithmetic (the labeling-internal comparisons keep the vendored
epsilon semantics; zero divergences observed in practice).

    Returns the parsed result JSON: ``exact_log`` (BCP execution log),
    ``incumbents`` (anytime UB stream), and ``value``/``routes`` when a
    solution was found. Routes are in Lera vertex numbering (see
    ``routes_to_mamut``).

    ``on_incumbent`` makes the solve anytime: it fires synchronously on
    every new BCP incumbent with the same record that lands in the result's
    ``incumbents`` array (``{"time", "value", "origin", "routes"}``, routes in
    Lera numbering). Keep the hook cheap — the solve blocks on it; an exception
    raised inside it aborts the solve and propagates.

    ``initial_routes`` warm-starts the BPC with heuristic incumbent
    routes as customer-id sequences without depots (``kayros.Solution.routes``
    fits directly). They are repriced under the solver's own arithmetic, added
    as initial columns, and — when they still partition the customers — their
    total becomes the initial upper bound; the result carries a ``warm_start``
    record. If the BPC proves optimality without improving on that bound, the
    result has the proven ``value`` but an **empty** ``routes`` list: the
    initial routes are the optimum and the caller already holds them.

    Gap diagnostic: on ``TimeLimitReached``, ``exact_log.best_bound``
    is a valid lower bound whenever the root relaxation finished (the best
    open node's bound; absent when the TL hit during root CG — a truncated
    restricted master value is *not* a valid bound), and
    ``exact_log.best_int_value`` the best upper bound, so
    ``(best_int_value - best_bound) / best_int_value`` is the proven gap.
    ``exact_log.root_lp_value`` carries the root LP bound itself.

    ``stab_alpha`` is the Neame dual-smoothing factor in [0, 1):
    pricing runs on EMA-smoothed duals with misprice-safe termination (CG
    only ever stops on true duals). Default 0.0 (off): smoothing measured
    monotonically harmful with the pool-based pricing ladder — experimental
    knob only. When on, the result carries a ``stabilization`` record.

    ``memory_limit_mb`` is the M13.2 memory self-guard: an RSS watermark the
    prover polls at the same points as the time-limit deadline. When crossed,
    the solve unwinds cleanly and returns ``exact_log.status ==
    "MemoryLimitReached"`` with honest bounds (an OPEN verdict, never a
    certificate), instead of the OS OOM-killing the process with no result
    (the full-horizon TDVRP label-accumulation pathology). ``None`` (default)
    resolves the limit from the machine: own RSS + ~80% of currently
    available memory, capped by the cgroup limit when one is set. ``0``
    disables the guard. The result's ``memory`` record carries the resolved
    limit, the peak RSS and whether the guard tripped.
