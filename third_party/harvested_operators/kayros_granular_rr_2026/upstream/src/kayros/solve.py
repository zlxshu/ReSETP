    (single-trajectory TD-ILS: granular VND + ruin-and-recreate +
    late-acceptance — the default since 0.4.0, picked by a 20,808-run
    head-to-head campaign where ILS beat ACO on 5714 of 6936 paired cells
    and lost 305, with the margin growing with instance size), ``"aco"``
    (TD-ACO, the historical default through 0.3.x), or ``"aco+ils"`` (an
    experimental budget split: ACO for ``aco_budget_fraction`` of the time
    limit, then ILS warm-started from the ACO best — statistically tied
    with pure ILS on small instances and dominated by it at scale).

    ACO parameter defaults are the original tuned bp_heur values; ILS
    defaults follow PyVRP v0.14 (restart threshold scaled to kayros's
    ms-class iterations). ``num_neighbours``/``weight_wait`` (granular
    candidate lists, M7.0) apply to the local search of EVERY strategy —
    default-on since 0.4.0; set ``num_neighbours=0`` for the pre-0.4.0
    exhaustive scans.

    ``objective`` picks the scored objective (1.2.0): ``"duration"`` (the
    default, unchanged behavior) or ``"fleet_cost_duration"``
    (FleetCostDuration: the same canonical duration fold plus
    ``fleet_fixed_cost * num_routes``, read from the instance; the lib
    ``ObjectiveFunction`` members are accepted too). Every strategy prices
    it through the same core fold; requires mamut-routing-lib >= 0.9.0 and

    (greedy seed, then single-trajectory TD-ILS; the default since 0.4.0,
    picked by the ILS-vs-ACO head-to-head campaign, see ``Params``). A
    default call (``params=None`` or ``Params()``) therefore involves no
    ant, colony or pheromone machinery: ACO only runs when explicitly
    requested via ``strategy="aco"`` or the experimental ``"aco+ils"``
    split.

    ``instance`` is a ``.vrp.json`` path or an already-loaded
    ``LoadedTDInstance``. The returned ``Solution.duration`` is priced by the
    reference checker under the selected objective; an internal/checker
    disagreement raises (it would be a kayros bug, never a rounding issue to
    tolerate).

    ``verify`` applies to the loading half only, and is forwarded to
    ``kayros.io.load_instance``: it re-derives the sidecar digests and the
    ``atf_sha256`` of the materialized arrival-time functions and pins them
    against what the instance file declares. Verify on test runs and on the
    first run over unfamiliar data, where the check catches a truncated
    download or a mismatched sidecar; leave it off afterwards, since
    materialization is deterministic and the check costs minutes and several
    gigabytes of peak memory at n = 1000. It is rejected when ``instance`` is
    an already-loaded ``LoadedTDInstance``, because by then the artifacts have
    been read and it is too late to verify them here.

    ``on_incumbent`` makes the solve anytime: it fires synchronously on every
    new incumbent with the ``Incumbent`` record and the routes, so callers can
    checkpoint solutions while the search keeps running. The stream is strictly
    improving and opens on the ``"greedy"`` seed within a fraction of a second
    at every instance size (1.4.0), well before the first descent lands. Keep
    the hook cheap — the solve loop blocks on it; an
    exception raised inside it aborts the solve and propagates.
