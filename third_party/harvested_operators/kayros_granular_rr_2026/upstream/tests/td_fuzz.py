"""Random TD-instance generation for differential prover testing (M5.9).

The exact BPC prover is verified against the ILS heuristic on *random* small
instances, the instance-level analogue of the ``pwlf_compare`` random-curve
tests. Random instances are built by **subsampling real benchmark instances**:
a random subset of customers is kept and relabelled, and the per-arc ATFs are
reused verbatim. This preserves genuine value-jump (stepwise) structure exactly
-- the feature that breaks the prover -- without synthesising ATFs from scratch.

Two soundness invariants are checked per instance (see
``test_prover_fuzz_soundness``):

  (S1) a certified optimum must not exceed any checker-valid feasible cost
       (the ILS solution); a proof cannot be worse than a known solution.
  (S2) the certified value must not depend on the warm start (cold == warm).

Both are violated exactly when the labeling misprices value jumps.
