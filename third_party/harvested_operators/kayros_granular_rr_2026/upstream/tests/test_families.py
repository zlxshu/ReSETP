"""M3.4: all four MAMUT TD families × both problem types.

For each satellite family (Ari2018, Vu2020, Rifki2020 — Dabia2013 is covered
exhaustively by test_checker_equivalence): a checker-equivalence spot check on
random routes and a small-budget solve() smoke. Rifki2020 is the stress case:
its canonical ATFs carry genuine vertical steps (non-FIFO envelope
consolidation), exercising the step semantics of the engine end to end.
