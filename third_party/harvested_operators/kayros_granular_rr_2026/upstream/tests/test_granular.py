"""M7.0 granular-LS gates (Stream 7, td-ils-design.md).

Discipline:
- neighbour lists: symmetric adjacency (union-symmetrised), deterministic,
  depot- and self-free, TW-infeasible edges excluded, monotone in k;
- granular local_search keeps every M3.7 invariant (partition, checker-exact
  value, never-worse) — candidate lists prune enumeration only, the repricing
  rule is untouched;
- with full lists the enumeration is justified everywhere, so granular must
  reproduce the exhaustive descent bitwise on TDVRP (no TW screen). On TDVRPTW
  the swap operator's pair-proximity justification may legitimately skip swaps
  between mutually TW-unreachable clients, so the identity gate is TDVRP-only.
