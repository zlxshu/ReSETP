"""Soundness gates for exact-BPC certification on stepwise (value-jump) ATFs.

Historical context (M5.9). The vendored Lera BPC *was* unsound on stepwise
travel-time functions (Rifki2020 and any future step-carrying family): value
jumps were mollified into 1e-3-wide steep bridge segments, whose
~1000*step-height slope turned the labeling's epsilon arithmetic and domain
clamps into O(step-height) merge/dominance mispricing. Negative-reduced-cost
columns were silently dropped and the branch-and-price closed at a wrong,
warm-start-dependent "optimum". See ``cpp/lera/NOTICE.md`` item 9 and the
2026-07-08 Rifki retraction report. Stepwise instances have run on the exact
tagged-vertical path since M13.0 and the forward-side mollifier is deleted; the
reverse-side normalizer (``continuize_value_jumps``) is retained because the
jump-free path needs it, and the gates below pin that (item 9, amendment 7).

These tests are the *specification* of the fix. The M5.9 numerics fix (exact
coordinate-swap ``Inverse`` for non-decreasing functions) made them pass on the
local build: the pricing incompleteness that certified 8376 > 8361 is gone
here, so the gates below are hard gates. **They are necessary, not sufficient**:
the 2026-07-10 g5k re-certification showed the residual mispricing is
BUILD-DEPENDENT (bit-identical payloads certify differently under gcc-13/Debian
vs the local NixOS toolchain; e.g. Rifki-25 n=10 cold 4820 vs true 4357 on g5k
only). These gates therefore pin local-build soundness against regressions;
they do not certify the prover on stepwise ATFs. See NOTICE item 9 and the
2026-07-10 campaign report. The guard tests (jump-free family) must stay green
throughout. Randomized coverage: ``test_prover_fuzz_soundness.py``.

The decisive minimal reproducer is TDVRPTW/Rifki2020/n=20/Rifki-16: cold solve
certifies ``Optimum 8376`` while the checker-valid solution below carries cost
8361 (a 124-unit / 1.46% refutation), and the certified value is warm-start
dependent (8485 / 8376 / 8361 from stored-BKS / cold / counterexample starts).
