"""M7.1 ruin-and-recreate gates (Stream 7, td-ils-design.md).

Discipline:
- feasible-only: the perturbed solution is always a complete feasible
  solution — partition preserved, checker-valid, canonical Duration;
- the kick is typically worsening (that is its job); what is asserted is
  validity, not improvement;
- seeded determinism: same input + seed => identical perturbed solution;
- the undo path leaves the input solution exactly restored when repair is
  impossible (forced via a fleet bound of zero slack and huge kicks).
