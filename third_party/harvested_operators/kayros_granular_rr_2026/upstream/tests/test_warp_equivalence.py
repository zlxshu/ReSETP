"""P8.1 hard gates: the warp-augmented fold must reduce bitwise to the checker.

Stream 8 (TD time-warp) exact-reduction gates, per the accepted P8.0 design
memo (workspace ``reports/design/p8.0-td-time-warp-design.md`` §4):

- **G1** — on every checker-feasible route, the zero-warp duration equals the
  checker's Delta* bitwise, the minimal warp is exactly 0.0, and the clamped
  ready-time function's breakpoint grid extends the checker's grid (bitwise
  prefix). Durations are asserted, argmins never (association-fragile).
- **G2** — the feasibility predicates agree exactly: checker domain non-empty
  ⇔ zero-warp set non-empty (exactly-zero warp, never a tolerance).
- **G3** — hand-built late routes get controlled warp values.

The C++ channels are additionally asserted bitwise against the pure-Python
reference twin (``tests/warp_reference.py``) built on the canonical lib
NDCPWLF algebra, mirroring the M3.2 checker-equivalence discipline.
